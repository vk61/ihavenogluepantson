    "Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.\n",

    "This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and shares similarities with Pair with Target Sum. A couple of differences are that the input array is not sorted and instead of a pair we need to find triplets with a target sum of zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "To follow a similar approach, first, we will sort the array and then iterate through it taking one number at a time. Letâ€™s say during our iteration we are at number X, so we need to find Y and Z such that X + Y + Z == 0. At this stage, our problem translates into finding a pair whose sum is equal to -X (as from the above equation Y + Z == -X).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference from Pair with Target Sum is that we need to find all the unique triplets. To handle this, we have to skip any duplicate number. Since we will be sorting the array, so all the duplicate numbers will be next to each other and are easier to skip.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sorting the array will take O(N * logN). The searchPair() function will take O(N). As we are calling searchPair() for every number in the input array, this means that overall searchTriplets() will take O(N * logN + N^2), which is asymptotically equivalent to O(N^2).\n",
    "Ignoring the space required for the output array, the space complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N) which is required for sorting.\n",

    "Given an array of unsorted numbers and a targetSum, find a triplet in the array whose sum is as close to the targetSum as possible, return the sum of the triplet. If there are more than one such triplet, return the sum of the triplet with the smallest sum.\n",

    "This problem follows the Two Pointers pattern and is quite similar to Triplet Sum to Zero.\n",
