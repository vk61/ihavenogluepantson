# I have no glue 🤕 pants on 
For all these year, I have tried to take up on myself to solve the DSA problems on my own. I believe that the patterns used to solve the DSA problems need not be taught. it should occur to myself while solving. I learned that it is not the case and I am dumb. Here , Now I am trying learning to learn the patterns now. So this is my guide and will always come back here to refresh on these patterns. 👉

# ✨ Sly thin win those 

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the problems asks us to find the minimum, maximum subarray or string, use sliding windows pattern.

# 👩🏼‍🎨 Tube Painters  

In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the two pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray. 👁️
