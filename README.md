# I have no glue 🤕 pants on 
For all these year, I have tried to take up on myself to solve the DSA problems on my own. I believe that the patterns used to solve the DSA problems need not be taught. it should occur to myself while solving. I learned that it is not the case and I am dumb. Here , Now I am trying learning to learn the patterns now. So this is my guide and will always come back here to refresh on these patterns. 👉

# ✨ Sly thin win those 

In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the problems asks us to find the minimum, maximum subarray or string, use sliding windows pattern.

# 👩🏼‍🎨 Tube Painters  

In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the two pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray. 👁️

# Pasta and Slow sauce Pointers ♨️

The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.

By moving at different speeds (say, in a cyclic LinkedList), the algorithm proves that the two pointers are bound to meet. The fast pointer should catch the slow pointer once both the pointers are in a cyclic loop.

# Merge Intervals ❤️‍🩹
This pattern describes an efficient technique to deal with overlapping intervals. In a lot of problems involving intervals, we either need to find overlapping intervals or merge intervals if they overlap.

Given two intervals (a and b), there will be six different ways the two intervals can relate to each other:

> 1. __a and b do not overlap__
> 2. __a and b overlap, b ends after a__
> 3. __a completely overlaps b__
> 4. __a and b overlap, a ends after b__
> 5. __b completly overlaps a__
> 6. __a and b do not overlap__
